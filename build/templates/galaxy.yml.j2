#
# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories
# that should not be included in the build artifact. A pattern is matched from
# the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files
# like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry', and '.git' are always filtered
#
# SECURITY NOTE: Ansible Galaxy does NOT support deleting collections that are uploaded
# to it. The only way to prevent files from showing up in your collection that contain
# secrets is to EXPLICITLY list them here. Those are a security disaster waiting to happen,
# but RedHat does not consider this an issue and will not fix it. The only ways to protect
# yourself when doing development and producing/pushing collections to Ansible Galaxy
# manually are to use file names that match the rule `*do_not_publish` and to create your
# collection file and double-check EVERY file included in it to make SURE that you do not
# accidentally create a file with sensitive content that is not explicitly excluded.
