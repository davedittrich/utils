# This playbook generates a `galaxy.yml` file from a template, inserting
# the current version number from the contents of the file `VERSION`
# and adding `build_ignore` items from files that are untracked by
# Git). This still leaks file and directory names, but is less likely
# to accidentally leak secrets or other files that you do not wish to
# end up in an Ansible Galaxy artifact as you CANNOT DELETE ANY FILES
# that are published there.
